 **Neural Network**
 A neural network is a machine learning (ML) model designed to mimic the function and structure of the human brain.
 that uses interconnected nodes or neurons in a layered structure that resembles the human brain.

 **Activation functions**

 An Activation Function decides whether a neuron should be activated or not. This means that it will decide whether the neuron's input to the network is important or not in the process of prediction using simpler mathematical operations.
