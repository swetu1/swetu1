 **Neural Network**
 A neural network is a machine learning (ML) model designed to mimic the function and structure of the human brain.
 that uses interconnected nodes or neurons in a layered structure that resembles the human brain.

 **Activation functions**

 An Activation Function decides whether a neuron should be activated or not. This means that it will decide whether the neuron's input to the network is important or not in the process of prediction using simpler mathematical operations.

 **Random intialisation of weight is important**

 **forward and backward propagation**

 Forward propagation sequentially calculates and stores intermediate variables within the computational graph defined by the neural network. It proceeds from the input to the output layer. Backpropagation sequentially calculates and stores the gradients of intermediate variables and parameters within the neural network in the reversed order. When training deep learning models, forward propagation and backpropagation are interdependent, and training requires significantly more memory than prediction.
